# Correlation-Between-Diet-and-CVD-Risk
This project examines the relationship between dietary quality, measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI‑2015), and predicted 10‑year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among U.S. adults. Using NHANES data (2011–2014), the analysis integrates Python and visualization tools to uncover patterns that inform nutrition guidelines and prevention strategies.

# Research Question
What is the relationship between dietary quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-
2015), and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among U.S. adults, and how do
demographic factors such as age and gender influence this relationship?

This question aims to uncover whether healthier eating patterns are statistically associated with
lower cardiovascular risk, and whether demographic subgroups experience different levels of
benefit.

# Data Sources

• National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011–2014)

• Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015)

• Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score

# Summary of Results 
The analysis found a moderate, statistically significant negative correlation (r = –0.57) between HEI‑2015 scores and predicted 10‑year CVD risk, showing that higher diet quality is linked to lower cardiovascular risk. Regression confirmed diet quality as an independent predictor of CVD risk, while age modestly increased risk and sex was not significant.

# Future Work
Future enhancements could include adding more risk factors such as physical activity, medication use, and income to improve predictive power. Expanding to longitudinal datasets and other nutrition‑related conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) would broaden the dashboard’s relevance and impact.
