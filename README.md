# Correlation-Between-Diet-and-CVD-Risk
Analysis exploring how dietary quality (HEI-2015) relates to predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk using NHANES-modeled data. Includes Python-based cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualizations to assess whether healthier diets are linked to lower CVD risk.
Research Question
What is the relationship between dietary quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-
2015), and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among U.S. adults, and how do
demographic factors such as age and gender influence this relationship?
This question aims to uncover whether healthier eating patterns are statistically associated with
lower cardiovascular risk, and whether demographic subgroups experience different levels of
benefit.
2. Data Sources
To answer this question, the following data sources will be used:
• National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011–2014)
o Publicly available dataset from the CDC.
o Includes demographic, dietary, and health outcome data for thousands of U.S.
adults aged 30–74.
• Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015)
o A standardized measure of dietary quality developed by the USDA.
• Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score
o A validated equation used to estimate 10-year CVD risk based on age, sex,
cholesterol, blood pressure, and other factors.
These sources provide a rich dataset that integrates dietary quality with health outcomes,
enabling correlation and regression analyses
