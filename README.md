# Correlation-Between-Diet-and-CVD-Risk
Analysis exploring how dietary quality (HEI-2015) relates to predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk using NHANES-modeled data. Includes Python-based cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualizations to assess whether healthier diets are linked to lower CVD risk.

# Research Question
What is the relationship between dietary quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-
2015), and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among U.S. adults, and how do
demographic factors such as age and gender influence this relationship?

This question aims to uncover whether healthier eating patterns are statistically associated with
lower cardiovascular risk, and whether demographic subgroups experience different levels of
benefit.
